        <h1>SMPLog - Documentation</h1>
    </header>
    <section class="container">
        <h2>Quick Start</h2>
        <p>Just follow the instructions in
            <a href="https://github.com/kiswa/SMPLog">the README</a> at the
            project's repo on GitHub!</p>
        <p>For a more detailed walkthrough, keep reading.</p>

        <div class="doc-block">
            <h2>After Install</h2>
            <p>The first time you visit your site after installation, it will look
                like this &rarr;</p>
            <div class="popup-image">
                <img src="images/01_default_home.png" alt="Default Home">
            </div>
            <p>This is the default display with no posts, and no changes to the
                default settings. The blog's name is SMPLog, the header just has a
                grey background, and there are no posts.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="doc-block">
            <h2>Admin Area</h2>
            <h3>Log In</h3>
            <p>The first thing you should do after getting SMPLog running is add
                <kbd>/admin</kbd> to the end of your address bar and hit
                <kbd>Enter</kbd>.</p>
            <p>This will take you to the admin login page, which looks like this
                &rarr;</p>
            <div class="popup-image">
                <img src="images/02_default_admin_login.png"
                    alt="Default Admin Login">
            </div>
            <p>SMPLog always has one admin user, with the username and password
                set to <kbd>admin</kbd>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="doc-block">
            <h3>Dashboard</h3>
            <p>Use this account for your first login, and you will see a page
                like the next image. This is the <strong>Dashboard</strong>, the
                default page when an author logs into SMPLog.</p>
            <div class="popup-image">
                <img src="images/03_default_admin_posts.png"
                    alt="Default Admin Posts">
            </div>
            <p>It always starts at the <strong>Posts</strong> tab, so you can
                manage your writings directly. Of course, there's nothing here
                yet.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="doc-block">
            <h3>Admin-Only Tab</h3>
            <p>As the admin user, you have an additional tab that is not
                available to standard users: the <strong>Authors</strong> tab.
                This tab allows you to create new accounts and remove existing
                accounts.</p>
            <div class="popup-image">
                <img src="images/04_default_admin_authors.png"
                    alt="Default Admin Authors">
            </div>
            <p>As you can see, there is only the admin user to start. The
                display name defaults to <strong>Anonymous</strong>, which you
                can change by going to the <strong>Settings</strong> tab.</p>
            <p>We'll come back to this page once we've taken care of the site
                settings.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="doc-block">
            <h3>Settings</h3>
            <p>On the <strong>Settings</strong> tab, you also have an additional
                section that does not appear for standard users: the <strong>
                Blog Details</strong> form.</p>
            <div class="popup-image">
                <img src="images/05_default_admin_settings.png"
                    alt="Default Admin Settings">
            </div>
            <p>This is where you can set the name of your blog to something
                other than <strong>SMPLog</strong> (if you want to). You can
                also set an image link to be displayed behind the site header.</p>
            <p>The description is used in the RSS feed for your blog, so make
                it something that describes your feed to possible readers.</p>
            <p>The <strong>Author Details</strong> form is where you can set the
                name that is displayed when the admin user creates a post. You
                can also set an image link for the various author displays across
                the blog.</p>
            <p>Last, but certainly not least, is the <strong>Change Password
                </strong> form. Go ahead and change the default password if you
                haven't done so already.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="doc-block">
            <p>Here you can see what it looks like after updating the various
                settings for the blog and the admin user.</p>
            <div class="popup-image">
                <img src="images/06_custom_admin_settings.png"
                alt="Custom Admin Settings">
            </div>
            <p>Notice that the title in the header has changed to match the new
                settings. All further screenshots will reflect these new site
                settings.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="doc-block">
            <h3>Adding Authors</h3>
            <p>Now that the site settings are taken care of, let's get back to
                that admin-only tab for adding additional authors. Of course,
                this is entirely optional, so skip this step if you are the
                sole author on your blog.</p>
            <div class="popup-image">
                <img src="images/07_custom_admin_authors.png"
                alt="Custom Admin Settings">
            </div>
            <p>All you have to do is enter a username for the new user (it must
                be unique for each user). Then enter a new password (twice to
                make sure) and you have a new user.</p>
            <p>The only restriction on passwords is that they cannot be empty.
                There are no silly restrictions about letters and numbers and
                whatnot. If you want a secure blog, use a good password.</p>
            <p>As you can see, I have added a second author with the username
                of <strong>test</strong>. All new users start with the same
                default display name of <strong>Anonymous</strong> and no set
                author image.</p>
            <p>To update these settings, log in as the new user and go to the
                <strong>Settings</strong> tab (as above).</p>
        </div>

        <div class="doc-block">
            <h3>New Post</h3>
            <p>Now that we've gone over all the settings, let's get some content
                onto the site!</p>
            <p>This is what the <strong>New Post</strong> tab looks like when
                you first open it &rarr;</p>
            <div class="popup-image">
                <img src="images/08_admin_new_post.png"
                alt="Admin New Post">
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="doc-block">
            <p>As you type into the form on the left side, the Preview pane
                automatically updates to show you how the markdown you write
                will be seen by visitors to your blog.</p>
            <div class="popup-image">
                <img src="images/09_admin_new_post_text.png"
                alt="Admin New Post Text">
            </div>
            <p>When on mobile devices the writing form is the first thing you
                see, and scrolling down (swiping up?) will bring the Preview
                pane into view.</p>
            <p>The <strong>Save</strong> button does exactly what you think it
                should. Use it often to make sure you don't lose any work.</p>
            <p>The <strong>Publish</strong> button sets the post to a published
                state so it can be seen by readers. When used, it clears the
                form so you can start on a new post.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="doc-block">
            <h3>Posts (Again)</h3>
            <p>Now that we have some content (and updated settings) the Posts
                tab on the Dashboard looks a bit different.</p>
            <div class="popup-image">
                <img src="images/10_custom_admin_posts.png"
                alt="Custom Admin Posts">
            </div>
            <p>Posts are listed (both published and unpublished) with buttons
                that allow you to change the publication state, edit the post,
                or delete the post.</p>
            <p>Editing a post uses basically the same setup as a new post, with
                the exception that the Publish button does not reset the form.
                Instead, it changes into an Unpublish button should you change
                your mind and want to continue editing.</p>
            <p>Go ahead and log out to see what the site looks like now that the
                settings have been updated and some content adaded.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="doc-block">
            <h3>Customized Blog</h3>
            <p>Now that there is a post, and the settings have been updated to
                give the blog a new name and header background, things look a
                fair bit different than they did at first.</p>
            <div class="popup-image">
                <img src="images/11_custom_home.png"
                alt="Custom Home">
            </div>
            <p>As you can see, posts are paginated. The posts are shown five
                per page, with the most recent first.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="doc-block">
            <h3>Post View</h3>
            <p>Clicking the post title, or the right angle brackets at the end
                of the text, will open the post for reading.</p>
            <div class="popup-image">
                <img src="images/12_post.png"
                alt="Post">
            </div>
            <p>The styling aims to provide a minimalist reading environment to
                reduce distraction to the reader.</p>
            <p>After the post, the author's image (if set) and name are
                displayed, as well as several links for sharing the post on
                various social media.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="doc-block">
            <h3>Posts by Author</h3>
            <p>Clicking the author's name, or the 'read more' link, will open
                a page listing out all posts by the author.</p>
            <div class="popup-image">
                <img src="images/13_posts_by_author.png"
                alt="Posts by Author">
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="doc-block">
            <h3>Enjoy!</h3>
            <p>That pretty much covers it. If you have any questions, or find
                an issue, please let me know on the
                <a href="https://github.com/kiswa/SMPLog">GitHub repo for SMPlog
            </a>.</p>
            <p>One last thing: SMPlog was created to work well on any device.
                Here's how it looks on a smartphone screen:</p>
